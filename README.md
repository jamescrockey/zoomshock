MSOA zoomshock indices a la De Fraja, Matheson, Rockey 2020 (DMR)

These are *not* the data reported in DMR which rely on confidential data. These instead are estimates computed using publically available 2011 Census data. As such, while the data are older than is ideal, and will not capture changes in occupation or commuting patterns since then. One advantage of these data is that as Census data they cover the entire British population.
